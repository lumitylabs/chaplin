## 🔎 Why? 
AI model responses are significantly improved when provided with relevant context to solve a task. However, each task requires a different type of context, and finding a good solution often involves connecting knowledge from different domains. Creating prompts with this level of depth is a laborious and time-consuming process. This is where Chaplin comes in, addressing several key challenges in using LLMs today:

🎯 __Lack of quality context__  
🎯 __Inconsistent, generic, or repetitive responses__  
🎯 __Frequent occurrence of hallucinations__  
🎯 __The difficulty and high time-cost of generating quality prompts that are dynamic, personalized, and scalable;__  
🎯 __Integration barriers with other systems__

## 💡 How does it Work?  
Chaplin is an AI agent orchestrator that allows you to create and manage specialized teams to solve complex tasks. Each agent acts as an expert in its field, processing information sequentially until the final answer is generated. With a flexible architecture, Chaplins are easy to share, test, and integrate into your projects, making them ideal for a wide range of applications.

## 🔌 API Integration
### **How to Integrate with the Chaplin API**  

1.  **Find your Chaplin ID:** After creating or selecting a Chaplin in the web interface, click the **API** button. This will reveal your unique `chaplin_id`.
2.  **View Examples:** In the same popup, you will find code examples for **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **cURL (CLI)** to get you started quickly.
3. The body of your request must be a JSON object containing two keys:
```json
{
  "chaplin_id": "YOUR_CHAPLIN_ID_HERE",
  "input": "Your text or prompt here"
}
```
### **Live Integration Example**  
You can find a demo project that uses the Chaplin API in the `/examples/web3museum` directory.
